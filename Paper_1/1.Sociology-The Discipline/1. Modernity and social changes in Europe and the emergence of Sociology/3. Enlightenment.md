## **Counter-Enlightenment Movement**

**(Also called Conservative Reaction to Enlightenment Period)**

### **Overview**:

The Counter-Enlightenment was a **conservative intellectual response** to the Enlightenment. It emerged as a critique of Enlightenment values such as **rationalism, individualism, secularism**, and **progressive change**. Conservative thinkers perceived these ideas as **disruptive to traditional social order** and **harmful to stability**.

---

### **Key Conservative Scholars**:

* **Louis de Bonald**
* **Joseph de Maistre**

These French conservative scholars **criticised Enlightenment ideas** for:

* Creating disorder in society (especially in the context of the **French Revolution**),
* Undermining religion, monarchy, and family,
* Promoting excessive rationality over tradition and emotion.

They proposed a return to the **Middle Ages**, a time they viewed as characterised by **stability, hierarchy, and harmony**.

---

## **Irving Zeitlin’s Ten Propositions of Conservative Criticism of Enlightenment**:

Irving Zeitlin summarised the **ten major criticisms** made by conservative thinkers in response to the Enlightenment. These are foundational for understanding conservative thought in sociology.

---

### 1. **Non-Rational Aspects**:

* Conservative scholars emphasised the importance of **non-rational factors** in social life (e.g. rituals, ceremonies, religious worship).
* These practices play a role in **reducing stress and anxiety**.
* Enlightenment's overemphasis on reason **neglected emotional and social well-being**.

---

### 2. **Role of the Individual**:

* Conservatives believe society is composed of **roles, relationships, and institutions**.
* Individuals merely fill these roles and are **not the basic unit** of society.
* Society is seen as **more than the sum of individuals**.

---

### 3. **Divine Origin of Society**:

* Society is viewed as a **divine creation**, designed by God.
* It is inherently **perfect** and **does not require reform**.
* Change is considered both unnecessary and potentially harmful.

---

### 4. **Importance of Hierarchy**:

* Existence of **hierarchy** is essential for the **smooth functioning** of society.
* Any attempt to **abolish or challenge hierarchical structures** leads to disorder and instability.

---

### 5. **Change as a Threat**:

* Change or revolution is viewed as a **threat to society**.
* Disruption of institutions such as **monarchy, religion, or family** can result in **chaos and collapse**.

---

### 6. **Society as the Primary Unit**:

* Conservatives regard **society**, not the individual, as the **core analytical unit**.
* Emphasis is placed on **collective order** over individual freedom.

---

### 7. **Interrelatedness of Social Institutions**:

* Society is a system where all parts are **interconnected** (similar to the human body).
* Change in one part (e.g. religion) **adversely affects** other parts (e.g. family, education).

---

### 8. **Disorganising Effects of Enlightenment**:

* Enlightenment-led revolutions (e.g. French Revolution, Industrial Revolution) had **destabilising effects** on institutions such as family and religion.
* Resulted in **anxiety, fear**, and **social fragmentation**.

---

### 9. **Essential Nature of Institutions**:

* Institutions like **family and religion** are **essential to individual and societal well-being**.
* They provide **emotional support, intimacy**, and **social bonding**.
* Enlightenment undermined these essential institutions.

---

### 10. **Usefulness over Ideology**:

* Conservatives value institutions for their **practical utility and continuity**, regardless of their ideological flaws.
* Even if institutions have negative aspects, their **positive role in stability** is considered more important.
* Enlightenment’s rational critique of institutions ignored their **functional necessity**.

---

### **Conclusion**:

The **10 propositions** outlined by Irving Zeitlin represent the intellectual basis of **conservative critique** of Enlightenment. These propositions:

* Reinforced the significance of **tradition, religion, hierarchy, and order**,
* Provided a **theoretical foundation** for the emergence of sociology as a discipline,
* Influenced **early sociologists** like Comte and Durkheim who valued order and social cohesion.

## Industrial Revolution (IR)

### Origin and Nature:

* Began around **1760 in England**, marking the transition from **agrarian society to industrial society**.
* Involved major **technological advancements** enabling **surplus production** through use of **inanimate energy** and **large-scale machinery**.

### Key Features:

1. **Mechanisation**

   * Use of machines like **Spinning Jenny**, **power looms**, etc.
   * Enabled mass production, especially in **textile industry**.

2. **Inanimate Sources of Energy**

   * Reliance on **steam engine** as a continuous power source.
   * Supported uninterrupted industrial activity.

3. **Factory System**

   * Shift from **home-based manual work** to **organized machine-based work**.
   * Separated **place of residence from workplace**.
   * Introduced **specialized division of labour**.

4. **Division of Labour**

   * Promoted **complex division of labour**, with each task broken into small parts.
   * Increased **specialization** and **worker efficiency**.
   * Resulted in higher productivity.

5. **Production for Market Consumption**

   * Production exceeded individual needs and was directed at **market demand**.
   * Led to **price reduction**, increased **consumer base**, and further surplus.

6. **Other Consequences**

   * **Urbanisation**: Growth of industrial towns.
   * **Transport**: Development of railways and roads.
   * **Communication**: Expansion of postal and telegraph services.

### Social Impact:

* Transformed **individual and social life**:

  * Economic growth on one hand.
  * On the other, **misery and poverty** for labourers.
* Disintegration of **joint families**, rise of **nuclear families**.
* **Wealth accumulation** among a few → increased **rich-poor divide**.
* Rise of **urban slums** due to poor living conditions.

### Conclusion:

* IR led to **complete restructuring of production methods**.
* Marked the onset of **economic modernity**, hence termed the **Industrial Revolution**.
