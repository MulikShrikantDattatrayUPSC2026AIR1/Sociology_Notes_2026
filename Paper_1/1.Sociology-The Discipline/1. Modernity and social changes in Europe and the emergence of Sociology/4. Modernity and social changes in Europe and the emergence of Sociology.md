## 1. Modernity : 

## Definition of Modernity

Modernity is derived from the Latin word *modus*, meaning “thinking new” or “different”.
It refers to a condition of social life that is significantly different from past human experiences.
Modernity challenges traditional customs and institutions by emphasizing reason, science, and rationality.

It is a complex concept, closely associated with institutional changes, value shifts, and technological developments.
It promotes institutions based on written laws, values based on equality and individualism, and scientific advancement with reliance on technology and non-human sources of energy.

## Dimensions of Modernity

Modernity encompasses political, economic, and ideological aspects.
Its emergence in Europe after the 15th century was marked by rationality, scientific temper, individualism, urbanisation, industrialisation, and religious reforms—each reflecting significant social change.

In essence, modernity indicates a shift from inward-looking, traditional collective wisdom to a future-oriented and forward-looking society.

Three major types of modernity can be classified as:

* Political modernity – reflected through the French Revolution
* Economic modernity – shaped by the Industrial Revolution
* Ideological modernity – influenced by the Renaissance and Enlightenment

## 2. Social Change in Europe : 

## Background of Social Change in Europe

Until the 5th century, most of Europe was under Roman rule.
Following the bifurcation and eventual decline of the Western Roman Empire, regional powers rose to dominance.
The period witnessed the supremacy of the church and the emergence of feudalism, with land becoming central to the economy. Religious authority and kinship-based institutions dominated social life.

This era is generally referred to as the "Dark Age" of European history.
It was marked by suppression of intellectual freedom, dominance of religious dogmas, and restrictions on innovation and artistic expression.
While other parts of the world progressed, Western Europe remained stagnant.

## Renaissance (Post 15th Century)

The Renaissance began with the fall of Constantinople in 1453, which led to the migration of scholars and intellectuals from the Byzantine Empire to Italy.
Supported by the patronage of wealthy merchant classes, particularly in Italy, there was a revival of Roman-era ideas and values.
This intellectual and cultural reawakening came to be known as the Renaissance.

The Renaissance fostered two major changes:

* Commercial Revolution
* Scientific Revolution

It led to a transformation in the outlook of European people toward society, encouraging new ideas and value systems.
However, the progress initiated during this period was halted by events such as:

1. The Council of Trent – which reinforced religious orthodoxy by declaring the Latin Bible as the only legitimate source.
2. The Counter-Reformation – which suppressed reformist efforts.

This contributed to the eventual decline of the Renaissance by the 17th century.

## Enlightenment and the Age of Reason

With the decline of the Renaissance emerged a new intellectual phase known as the Age of Reason.
This period introduced a fresh way of thinking where reason and critical analysis became central tools for evaluating social institutions.
It encouraged a scientific and evidence-based approach to understand and reform society.

The Enlightenment marked the beginning of using reason as the foundation for social progress and institutional change.
It also laid the intellectual groundwork for the French and Industrial Revolutions.

## Social Transformations Due to French and Industrial Revolutions

### French Revolution:

The French Revolution was a manifestation of political modernity.
It promoted the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and dismantled the monarchy and the domination of religious institutions.

### Industrial Revolution:

The Industrial Revolution brought about massive economic and social transformations.
It led to the development of urban settlements, emergence of the factory system, and issues such as poverty, overcrowding, and disintegration of the traditional family structure.

Together, both revolutions led to scrutiny and transformation of existing social orders and institutions.

## 3.  Emergence of Sociology

### Need for a New Discipline: Birth of Sociology

The combined effects of rapid change, urban unrest, and the breakdown of traditional social structures led to increased anxiety, restlessness, and disorder in society.

There emerged a need for a new discipline that could explain and systematically study these changes.
Such a discipline was expected to not only interpret social phenomena but also offer solutions to emerging problems.

This need led to the **birth of sociology in 1839**, with the aim of using scientific methods to understand and guide society.

### Contexts Behind the Emergence of Sociology

### General Context:

* Renaissance
* Enlightenment
* Industrial Revolution

These developments laid the broader intellectual and structural foundation for the discipline of sociology.

### Immediate Context:

* French Revolution and its aftermath, marked by the replacement of monarchy with republicanism, followed by social disorder and chaos.
  This created an urgent necessity to study society in a structured manner.
