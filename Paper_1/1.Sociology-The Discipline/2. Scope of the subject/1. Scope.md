## Meaning of Scope

Scope of sociology refers to its subject matter or the boundary within which it operates as a discipline. It defines what sociology will study and the extent of its academic and practical inquiry.

With the emergence of sociology in the year 1839, the question of what sociology should study gained importance. The debate on the scope of sociology arose primarily because several other disciplines such as history, economics, and political science also dealt with aspects of society. Sociology, however, claimed society as its central subject matter.

This overlapping of subject matter created confusion and led to the absence of a clearly defined subject matter for sociology. Consequently, it resulted in intellectual debates among scholars to define the boundary or subject matter of sociology. The discussions around its scope evolved over different time periods.

## Evolution of the Scope of Sociology

### Phase I: Synthetic or Encyclopedic School (1834–1880)

This period was marked by the work of early sociologists who believed that the entire social life should come under the scope of sociology. They advocated for a comprehensive study of society, assuming that every aspect of social life is within the domain of sociological enquiry.

The dominant belief was that sociology is the study of society in its totality. Therefore, this school adopted a macro perspective in its analysis. Major contributors to this school include Auguste Comte and Emile Durkheim, both of whom belonged to France. Hence, this approach is also referred to as the French School.

### Phase II: Formal or Specialized School (1880–1940)

Following the limited success of the synthetic school in attempting to study every aspect of society, scholars recognized the need for a more focused approach. They argued that a complete study of all dimensions of social life was not feasible. As a result, the formal school confined sociology to the study of specific aspects such as human behaviour, social action, and micro-level processes.

Key scholars in this school included Max Weber, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Georg Simmel. These thinkers were associated with Germany, and the school is often referred to as the German School.

### Phase III: Integrationist School (1940–1980)

During this phase, scholars realized that the rigid separation between micro and macro perspectives was counterproductive. A purely structural or purely action-oriented approach was considered inadequate for a comprehensive understanding of society.

Sociology, as a systematic discipline, was expected to offer a holistic analysis. Hence, scholars proposed a blend of both micro and macro perspectives. This led to the emergence of the integrationist school, which supported the intermixing of formal and synthetic approaches. Major thinkers associated with this school include Talcott Parsons, R.K. Merton, and C.W. Mills. Since these scholars were based in the United States, this approach is also known as the American School.

### Phase IV: Sociology of Issues (Post-1980s onwards)

With the rise of new societal challenges such as biotechnology, environmental degradation, and information technology, existing schools of thought were found inadequate to sociologically engage with these issues. This gave rise to a new school of thought referred to as the Sociology of Issues.

This phase primarily focused on the in-depth study of issues like poverty, education, gender, and marginalisation. Alongside this, other schools of thought also emerged during this period.

Notable among these were:

* **Chicago School**: Focused on urban studies and contemporary social problems using symbolic interactionist methodology. Key thinkers include Louis Wirth and G.H. Mead.
* **Frankfurt School or Critical School**: Also known as the neo-Marxist school, it aimed to merge Marxist theory with cultural critique. Scholars include Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer.
* **Feminist School**: Gained prominence in the 1960s, offering gender-based analysis of social reality. Key contributors include Ann Oakley, Kate Millett, Carol Smart, and Shulamith Firestone.
* **Postmodernist School**: Emerged in the 1980s, rejecting the ideas of modernity and questioning its assumptions. Key thinkers include Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault.

## Challenges in Defining the Scope

Sociologist Walter Sprott has noted that the effort to define sociology’s scope is akin to a "brave attempt to confine an enormous mass of slippery material into a simple system of pigeon holes." This reflects the inherent difficulty in limiting sociology to a fixed domain due to the dynamic nature of society.

## Conclusion

The scope of sociology has been defined differently by scholars across time periods, influenced by the societal context and intellectual developments of each era. Since sociology studies society, which is inherently dynamic and ever-changing, it is not only difficult but also undesirable to confine its scope within rigid boundaries. Sociology must remain flexible and responsive to contemporary realities.
