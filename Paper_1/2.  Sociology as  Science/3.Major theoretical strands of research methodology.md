# **Theoretical Strands of Research Methodology in Sociology**

---

## **1. What is a Theoretical Strand?**

* Refers to the **underlying framework or worldview** that guides how research is conducted, analysed, and interpreted.
* It reflects **core beliefs and assumptions** that researchers follow in their research which help in :

  * Shaping method they use.
  * Questions they ask
  * Analysis they follow

 *E.g.*, Functionalism, Marxism → theoretical strands aligned with **Positivist methodology**.

---

## **2. What is Methodology?**

* Systematic study of research **methods** that provide framework for researchers that help in their research work.

* Concerned with:

  * **Nature and quality of data** produced
  * **Logic and reasoning** behind method
  * Frameworks that help researchers conduct rigorous research.

## **3. Major Theoretical strand of research methodology includes:**

### **A. Functionalism (Linked to Positivism)**

* It is for theory building that consider anything is made up of interconnected part and subparts working together in the manner that establishes concensus and social order.
* It tends to follow "Organismic Anology" to the research subject.

Thus Functionalism is a theory used to **understand and build models of society**. It believes that everything—like society or any social group—is made of **interconnected parts** (called structures) that work **together to maintain stability and order**.

It uses the idea of **"Organismic Analogy"** – just like parts of a body (heart, lungs, brain) work together, **parts of society** do the same.

###  1. Features of Functionalism:

#### (a) Structure

* Focuses on the **form or shape** of the research subject.
* Breaks it down into **smaller parts or subunits** to understand the whole.

 **Example**: While studying society, functionalists look at **family, kinship, education, religion** as separate structures that together shape social life.

#### (b) Function

* Focuses on the **utility of structure** (what role each part plays).
* **Example**: The **family** plays a function of **socialisation** (teaching values) and **reproduction** (biological continuation of society).

#### (c) Functional Pre-requisites (AGIL)

Parsons said that **every social system** (like family, school, society) must fulfil **4 basic needs** to survive and remain stable. These are called **AGIL**:


| Code | Need                | Meaning                                          | Example in Family                           |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| A    | **Adaptation**      | Adjusting to the environment, securing resources | Family earns income to survive              |
| G    | **Goal Attainment** | Setting and working towards objectives           | Planning children’s future                  |
| I    | **Integration**     | Maintaining coordination and unity among parts   | Managing conflicts, shared responsibilities |
| L    | **Latency**         | Passing values and culture for future stability  | Teaching children norms and values          |

---

#### (4) Value Consensus

* Society works **smoothly when its members agree** on roles, norms, and values.
* This shared understanding keeps things going.

 **Example**: In a family, there is usually a **consensus** on who earns, who cooks, who takes care of children—this creates balance and reduces tension.

---

#### (5) Social Order

* Functionalism says **stability is key**.
* There must be a **balance between continuity and change** to keep society orderly.

  **Example**: A family changes over time (kids grow up, roles shift) but it still maintains **stability** because its **functions and structure** remain intact.

---

### **5. Criticism of Functionalism**

*(From thinkers like Marxists, Feminists, Postmodernists, Phenomenologists, etc.)*

---

### **1. Determinism**

* Functionalism views society as a system where everything is **pre-determined to serve a purpose**.
* It assumes that **every structure exists because it is useful**, and that society is always moving towards order and stability.
* **Critique**: It ignores **individual agency** and the possibility that actions may not serve a functional role.
* *Example*: If an individual chooses a homosexual companionship, it may lead to family disruption — a possibility not acknowledged by functionalist theory which sees family only as a stable unit.

---

### **2. Illegitimate Teleology**

* Teleology means explaining something in terms of its end or purpose.
* Functionalism assumes **every social structure exists for a specific purpose**, which may not always be true.
* It **ignores unintended consequences** or the multifunctionality of institutions.
* *Example*: Schools are viewed only as institutions for education. But in reality, they also serve other roles like **employment generation**, **social control**, **reproduction of inequality**, etc.

---

### **3. Inability to Explain Social Change**

* Functionalism focuses on **equilibrium**, **stability**, and **continuity**.
* It fails to explain **rapid or revolutionary changes**, which often occur due to conflict, resistance, or contradiction within social structures.
* *Example*: Functionalism cannot account for revolutions like the **French Revolution**, **Russian Revolution**, or **Civil Rights Movement**, which brought radical transformation in society.

---

### **4. Postmodernist Critique – Grand Narrative Fallacy**

* Postmodernists argue that **functionalism constructs a “meta-narrative”**, trying to explain all aspects of society under one model.
* It assumes that society is a coherent, integrated whole.
* *Critique*: Society is **diverse, fragmented, and fluid** — no single model (like functionalism) can fully explain it.
* *Example*: Functionalists claim to study all aspects of society, but this is **not practically possible** due to constant change and multiplicity of meanings.

---

### **5. Utopian & Idealistic Vision**

* Functionalism paints an overly **harmonious and conflict-free picture** of society.
* It emphasises **solidarity**, **value consensus**, and **integration**, ignoring inequality and contradictions.
* *Marxist Critique*: Functionalism ignores **class conflict**, **power struggles**, and **oppression**.
* *Example*: Within families, functionalism overlooks **gender conflict** — it ignores the tension that may arise due to patriarchal structures.

---

### **6. Tautology**

* Functionalist explanations are often **circular** in logic — the explanation and the conclusion are the same.
* Tautology means saying the same thing twice in different words.
* *Example*: Saying “law exists because society needs law” doesn’t explain **how** or **why** it came into being — it's a **mere restatement** of the assumption.

---

### **7. Ethnomethodology & Phenomenology Critique**

* These approaches argue that **social reality is constructed by individuals** through their daily interactions.
* Functionalism wrongly assumes that social facts exist **objectively** and are **externally imposed** on individuals.
* *Critique*: Reality is not fixed — it is **fluid and shaped by interpretation**.
* People **construct meaning**, and functionalism ignores this **subjective dimension**.
* *Conclusion*: Functionalism fails to acknowledge that meaning is **created and recreated** through interaction.

---

### **8. Vague, Abstract & Ambiguous Concepts**

* Many functionalist ideas are **not precisely defined**.
* Concepts like “function” or “functional prerequisite” are vague.
* *Example*: What exactly is the function of religion, or the function of kinship? Different scholars provide different answers — making it hard to generalise or measure.

---

### **9. Feminist Critique**

* Functionalism often **ignores women’s experiences** and contributions.
* It presents a **male-centric view**, where roles are traditionally assigned — men as breadwinners, women as housewives.
* *Critique*: It **fails to account for oppression**, **gender-based violence**, or **the burden of unpaid labour**.
* Feminists argue that **families can also be sites of domination**, not just socialisation and stability.

---

## Despite Criticism: What Functionalism Contributed

* Provided a **systematic and organised framework** to study society.
* Helped understand how different **institutions contribute to social order**.
* Laid foundation for **early structural sociology** (especially in the work of Emile Durkheim and Parsons).
* Gave tools for analysing **institutional stability** and **value consensus**, particularly in relatively stable, traditional societies.

---

## Note:

> Functionalism offers a **macro-level perspective** that is useful for understanding structure and order, but is limited when dealing with **conflict, diversity, and change**. A balanced answer must acknowledge both its **theoretical utility** and **empirical limitations**.

---


### Summary:

Functionalism explains society by:

* **Breaking it down into parts (structure)**
* **Understanding each part's role (function)**
* **Ensuring society survives by fulfilling AGIL needs**
* **Promoting value consensus for smooth coordination**
* **Maintaining social order through controlled change**

---


### **B. Marxism**

---

## **Introduction**

Marxism is a radical and conflict-based perspective developed by **Karl Marx**, aiming to explain the **structure of society** and its transformation through the lens of **economic and class relations**. Unlike functionalism, which focuses on order and consensus, Marxism views society as inherently **divided and conflict-ridden**, primarily due to the **economic inequality** embedded in the **mode of production**.

---

## **Core Concepts of Marxism**

### 1. **Means of Production (MoP)**

These refer to the **tools, technologies, resources, and land** used in the process of producing goods and services.
**Example:** Land, seeds, machinery, ploughs used in farming.

### 2. **Forces of Production (FoP)**

The **means of production along with human labour** form the forces of production. It represents the **productive capacity** of a society.
**Formula:** FoP = MoP + Labour

### 3. **Relations of Production (RoP)**

This refers to the **social relationships** between individuals in the production process. It operates on two levels:

* **Man and Thing**: Ownership or non-ownership of resources.
* **Man and Man**: Dominance or subordination (e.g., employer-employee, capitalist-worker).

### 4. **Mode of Production**

It is the **combination of forces of production and relations of production**, which forms the **economic base** of any society.
Different historical stages (like **feudalism, capitalism, socialism**) are defined by their unique modes of production.

---

## **Class and Class Conflict**

### 1. **Class Definition**

A class is determined by a person’s **relationship to the means of production**. Marx categorised society into two broad classes:

* **Bourgeoisie (Haves)** – Owners of the means of production.
* **Proletariat (Have-nots)** – Those who only possess their labour.

### 2. **Antagonistic Cooperation**

Even though both classes are required for the production process, their interests are fundamentally opposed/antagonistic, leading to what Marx calls **"antagonistic cooperation"**.

### 3. **Exploitation and Resistance**

The proletariat often feels exploited in the production process. This exploitation **intensifies with time**, leading to **resistance and class struggle**.

### 4. **Class Consciousness and Revolution**

As exploitation grows, the working class becomes aware of their condition (**class consciousness**) and eventually revolts with a hope of ending exploitation, which can **lead to revolution and social change**.
This provides a **justification for conflict and revolutionary change** in Marxist theory.

---

## **Marxism as a Theoretical Stand**

Marxism believes that **all historical developments and social structures** can be understood through the **binary of haves and have-nots**, rooted in class conflict. It emphasizes that:

* **Contradictions** in class interests are **permanent** and fuel social change.
* Ideologies of the ruling class maintain the **status quo** through cultural dominance.
* Real change comes through **conflict, not consensus**.

**Example:** In any modern industry, the owners (bourgeoisie) and workers (proletariat) have **contradictory interests** — one aims to maximise profit, the other to secure wages and working conditions. This contradiction manifests as class struggle.

---

## **Criticisms of Marxism**

### 1. **Postmodernist Critique**

Marxism is critiqued as a **meta-narrative** — an overly broad and simplistic theory that tries to explain all aspects of social life through class.
In sociological terms, a **meta-narrative** is an overarching, universal theory or explanation that claims to interpret all aspects of society through a single lens—like class, progress, or modernity.

Postmodernists argue that reality is **fragmented and pluralistic**, not reducible to economic class alone.

### 2. **Feminist Critique**

Feminist scholars argue that Marxism **overlooks gender-based exploitation**.
By focusing solely on class, it ignores how **patriarchy and capitalism** interact to suppress women.

### 3. **Interpretive Sociology Critique**

Scholars like Weber and symbolic interactionists argue Marxism is **too deterministic and ideologically biased**, ignoring **micro-level social interactions** and **subjective meanings**.

### 4. **Overemphasis on Conflict**

Critics claim Marxism overemphasises conflict and revolution, ignoring **stability, continuity, and consensus** that also exist in societies.

### 5. **Neglect of Individual Agency**

Marxism gives little room to **individual choices or roles** in shaping history, focusing only on **structural and class forces**.

### 6. **Shared Problem with Functionalism**

Ironically, while Marxism critiques functionalism for focusing on **solidarity**, both end up assuming that people act in predictable group-based ways — either all **have** or **have not**.

---

## **Conclusion**

Despite criticism, Marxism remains one of the most **powerful and enduring frameworks** in sociology. It provides deep insight into:

* **Class structure**
* **Economic inequality**
* **Power dynamics**
* And the role of **ideology in maintaining dominance**

It’s particularly relevant today in analysing **capitalism, labour movements, economic crises**, and **global inequality**.

---

#### **Methods Used in Positivism**

---

Positivism emphasizes **empirical, scientific, and objective methods** for studying social phenomena. Thinkers like **Auguste Comte**, **Emile Durkheim**, and to some extent **Karl Marx** used positivist methods to understand society.

---

## **1. Comparative Method**

* Compares societies **across time, regions, or cultures** to identify patterns.
* Focuses on **commonalities and differences** in social behaviour.

**Example:**

* Karl Marx compared **ancient, feudal, and capitalist societies** to understand changes in the mode of production.
* Durkheim compared **European societies** to study suicide patterns. He took data from different european countries relating to suicide from 1840s till 1870s and compare them to conclude 4 types of suicide

---

## **2. Historical Method**

* Studies the **past** to understand how institutions or behaviour **evolve over time**.
* Involves collecting long-term data from records, documents, etc.

**Example:**

* Marx used historical data to analyse **class formation** and also collected past data to categorise them into different type.
* Weber studied the **Protestant ethic** and **emergence of capitalism** in Europe using past data.

---

## **3. Empirical Method**

* Based on **sensory observation** and **real-world data**.
* Focuses on **verifiable evidence**, typically through fieldwork and surveys.

**Example:**

* Eden’s book *“State of Poor”* and John Sinclair’s *“Statistical Account of Scotland”* used empirical data to highlight/conclude poverty as a social phenomena.

---

## **4. Causation Method**

* Explores **cause-effect relationships** between two or more variables.
* Highly structured and quantitative.

**Example:**

* Durkheim in his study on **suicide** identified two key causes: **integration** and **regulation**.

---

## **5. Statistical Analysis**

* Uses **numbers and data** to identify trends.
* Helps in generating **objective, quantifiable** findings.

**Example:**

* Census data on **literacy rate** and **sex ratio** used to understand social development patterns:

  * Literacy (1951): 18% → (2011): 74.04%
  * Sex Ratio (2001): 933/1000 → (2011): 943/1000

---

## **6. Multivariate Analysis**

* Studies the **interaction between multiple variables**.
* Helps understand how **change in one** affects the **others**.

**Example:**

* Durkheim used multivariate analysis in his suicide study, linking religion, marital status, and social integration.

---

## **Conclusion**

Positivist methods continue to guide **scientific research in sociology**. While later schools (interpretive, critical, feminist) have critiqued it for rigidity, its **emphasis on objectivity, data, and analysis** laid the foundation for sociology as a science.
