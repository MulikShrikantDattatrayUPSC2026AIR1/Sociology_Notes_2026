---

## **1. What is a Theoretical Strand?**

* Refers to the **underlying framework or worldview** that guides how research is conducted, analysed, and interpreted.
* It reflects **core beliefs and assumptions** that researchers follow in their research which help in :

  * Shaping method they use.
  * Questions they ask
  * Analysis they follow

 *E.g.*, Functionalism, Marxism → theoretical strands aligned with **Positivist methodology**.

## **2. What is Methodology?**

* Systematic study of research **methods** that provide framework for researchers that help in their research work.

* Concerned with:

  * **Nature and quality of data** produced
  * **Logic and reasoning** behind method
  * Frameworks that help researchers conduct rigorous research.

## **3. Major Theoretical strand of research methodology includes:**

### **A. Functionalism (Linked to Positivism)**

* It is for theory building that consider anything is made up of interconnected part and subparts working together in the manner that establishes concensus and social order.
* It tends to follow "Organismic Anology" to the research subject.

Thus Functionalism is a theory used to **understand and build models of society**. It believes that everything—like society or any social group—is made of **interconnected parts** (called structures) that work **together to maintain stability and order**.

It uses the idea of **"Organismic Analogy"** – just like parts of a body (heart, lungs, brain) work together, **parts of society** do the same.

###  Features of Functionalism:

#### (a) Structure

* Focuses on the **form or shape** of the research subject.
* Breaks it down into **smaller parts or subunits** to understand the whole.

 **Example**: While studying society, functionalists look at **family, kinship, education, religion** as separate structures that together shape social life.

#### (b) Function

* Focuses on the **utility of structure** (what role each part plays).
* **Example**: The **family** plays a function of **socialisation** (teaching values) and **reproduction** (biological continuation of society).

#### (c) Functional Pre-requisites (AGIL)

Parsons said that **every social system** (like family, school, society) must fulfil **4 basic needs** to survive and remain stable. These are called **AGIL**:


| Code | Need                | Meaning                                          | Example in Family                           |
| ---- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| A    | **Adaptation**      | Adjusting to the environment, securing resources | Family earns income to survive              |
| G    | **Goal Attainment** | Setting and working towards objectives           | Planning children’s future                  |
| I    | **Integration**     | Maintaining coordination and unity among parts   | Managing conflicts, shared responsibilities |
| L    | **Latency**         | Passing values and culture for future stability  | Teaching children norms and values          |

---

#### (4) Value Consensus

* Society works **smoothly when its members agree** on roles, norms, and values.
* This shared understanding keeps things going.

 **Example**: In a family, there is usually a **consensus** on who earns, who cooks, who takes care of children—this creates balance and reduces tension.

---

#### (5) Social Order

* Functionalism says **stability is key**.
* There must be a **balance between continuity and change** to keep society orderly.

  **Example**: A family changes over time (kids grow up, roles shift) but it still maintains **stability** because its **functions and structure** remain intact.

---

## Summary:

Functionalism explains society by:

* **Breaking it down into parts (structure)**
* **Understanding each part's role (function)**
* **Ensuring society survives by fulfilling AGIL needs**
* **Promoting value consensus for smooth coordination**
* **Maintaining social order through controlled change**

## **4. Types of Research Methodologies**

| **Strand**       | **Positivism**                                          | **Non-Positivism**                                            | **Anti-Positivism**                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Understanding**         |Objective understanding of  Objective reality                                       | Subjective understanding of objective reality                          | Subjective understanding of subjective reality        |
| **Method**       | Uses scientific method & tools                          | Develops alternate methods aligned with scientific **spirit** | Rejects scientific method entirely           |
| **Focus**        | Understand general laws & patterns                      | Understand **meaning and culture**                            | Record experiences without generalising      |
| **Examples**     | Statistical analysis, comparison, multivariate analysis | Verstehen, Ideal Type, Cultural Pluralism                     | Ethnomethodology, Feminism, Post-modernism   |
| **Key Thinkers** | Auguste Comte, Emile Durkheim                           | Max Weber, Wilhelm Dilthey                                    | Feminist thinkers, Garfinkel, Postmodernists |
