## **Science, Scientific Method, and Its Critique**

---

### **Definition of Science**

* **Science** is a systematic body of knowledge based on **sensory observation** and **empirical data**.
* It is **certified knowledge**, **self-correcting**.
* Science and Scientific Method is reflecting in its methodology, spirit and essence 

  * **Methodology**: Way of conducting research (observation, experimentation, generalization).
  * **Spirit**: scientific exploration Driven by rationality and logic.
  * **Essence**: Search for truth behind phenomena to solve that problems.

---

### **Scientific Method: Nature & Process**

A systematic and objective process/attempt to:

* Study problems.
* Derive **general principles** for solutions.

According to **Robert Burns**, the scientific method is a **systematic investigation** aimed at finding solutions to problems by arriving at **law-like generalisations**.

* It involves a step-by-step exploration of phenomena using:

  * **Empirical observations**
  * **Rational enquiry**
  * **Experimentation**
* The goal is to ensure **universal applicability** and **objective understanding** of social or natural issues.

In essence, it’s a logical process that helps build **reliable and verifiable knowledge** through structured inquiry.

### **Horton & Hunt: 8 Characteristics of Scientific Method**

1. **Verifiable Evidence** – Must be based on **empirically observable facts**.
2. **Precision** – Avoid vagueness, ensure **exact measurement**, ensuring consistent and precise results
3. **Accuracy** – Describe things **as they are**, true to value.
4. **Controlled Conditions for collecting data** – Ensure **uniformity and control** to avoid variation.
5. **Training of Investigator** – Impart **research skills and knowledge**.
6. **Objectivity** – Eliminate **personal bias**.
7. **Recording** – Maintain detailed records to avoid **memory errors**.
8. **Systematization** – Organize data for **future reference**.

### **R.K. Merton’s idea "Ethos of Science"** – 4 Norms of Scientific Community

In his book "Sociology of science" - Forwarded this idea ,It is a  suggestions to scientists  in scientific community to follow , ensuring they live upto the expectations of science. It includes 4 principles : 

1. **Communism** – Scientific knowledge is **public good** and to be used for benefitting communities and not to restrict its access which is against the spirit of science (e.g. Human Genome Project).
2. **Universalism** – Scientific Knowledge is **universally testable**, not based on personal/national opinion (e.g. Pluto delisted as planet) in IAU meeting.
3. **Disinterestedness** – Avoid personal gain from their scientific ideas; focus/serve on its broader **societal benefit** (e.g. Jonas Salk refused to patent polio vaccine).
4. **Organized Skepticism** – Any  scientific investigation must be open for Critical scrutiny and peer review (e.g. IPCC reports),to identify its errors and limitations.


R.K merton's this suggestions appeared during WW-II, when many scientists were deviated from their own scientific principles/commitment. Rather than making use of science for the benefit of society/humanity , they were involved in its use in making weapons of mass destructions , chemical weapons, fighter jets etc . Thus through this sugesstions he made appeal to all scientists to return to the original ethos of science

### **Steps of Scientific Investigation** (Horton & Hunt)

1. **Identification of Problem** – Must be **worthy of investigation**.
2. **Review of Literature** – Understand past research.
3. **Formulation of Hypothesis** – Tentative assumption to be tested. In this step researcher must formulate hypothesis and its possible solutions
4. **Research Design** – Blueprint of methodology to be followed in research.
5. **Data Collection** – Via primary or secondary sources.
6. **Data Analysis** – Through classification, comparison.
7. **Generalization & Conclusion** – Identify patterns and build theory.Thus concluding outcome of the whole research
8. **Replication of Study** – Re-test for **universality and applicability**.

### **Example of Scientific Method Application**

Topic: *Effect of soil on plant growth*

* Follows all 8 steps (problem, hypothesis, design, data, etc.)
* Conclusion verifies hypothesis — black soil supports better growth.

---

Thus In this way , scientific method is a systematic approach to derive a solution of any problem using science and its principle. It reduces uncertainity and facilitate understanding of a problem and its solution.

### **Critique of Scientific Method (Major Thinkers)**

1. **Paul Feyerabend** – Warns against “epistemological anarchy”; one-size-fits-all method isn't valid for all disciplines.

2. **Theodor Adorno (Frankfurt School)** – Critiques science for enabling **weapons of mass destruction** and capitalist domination.

      Theodor Adorno, in his book *"The Authoritarian Personality"*, argued that **science can become a tool for domination**, serving authoritarian and capitalist interests. He warned that science, when detached from ethics, may legitimize **oppression rather than liberation**.


3. **Carl Jung** – States that emotions like happiness/sadness aren't **quantifiable**, hence excluded from scientific analysis/investigation.

4. **Karl Popper** in his Book "Logic of Scientific Discovery" – Highlights:

   * Science only explores **empirical truth**, not **absolute truth**.
   * science fails to **distinguish science from pseudoscience**.
   * Scientific truth is **falsifiable**. Truth in totality cannot be explained  by science.

5. **Thomas Kuhn** – Science doesn’t always follow objectivity; relies on **assumptions** and **paradigm shifts**.

6. **Jürgen Habermas** – Science is **as limited** as other disciplines; subject to **bias and contextual constraints**.
7. Ethos of science by R.K merton

### **Conclusion**

* Science and its method are **useful and reliable**, but:

  * Cannot explain all aspects of reality.
  * Not a **panacea** for every human problem.
* Sociology uses **scientific spirit** and methods but not rigid natural science standards — making it a **Social Science**.
