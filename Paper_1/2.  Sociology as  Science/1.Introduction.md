## **Sociology as a Science**

###  **Background Context**

* During the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment periods, **science was seen as a liberator** from superstition, religious dogma, and myths.
* This period emphasized **rationality and empirical reasoning**.
* Due to this many disciplines began to claim itself as **scientific** discipline . Sociology, too, emerged as a **scientific study of society**.
* Sociology emerges as a discipline to study society from scientific perspective.
* It claimed to be science of society.
* Early Sociologists took great pride in corelating and establishing scientific terms and methods in sociological enquiry.

###  **Foundational Thinkers & Contributions**

* **Saint Simon**: Called sociology "Social Physics", emphasized that society could be studied scientifically,Just like physics studies natural phenomena.

* **Auguste Comte**:

  * Coined the term "Sociology".
  * Proposed scientific approach in studying of social phenomena including the ideas of **social dynamics** , **social statics** , Hierarchy of science and law of 3 stages.

* **Herbert Spencer**:

  * Used **organic analogy** — society is like a living organism (birth, growth, decline).
  * Promoted **social Darwinism**.
* **Émile Durkheim**:

  * Treated sociology as a **scientific discipline**.
  * Used tools like **comparison**, **statistical methods**, and **multivariate analysis** to study society and human behaviour.

###  **Scientific Characteristics of Sociology**

#### 1. **Empirical & Verifiable Observation**

* Sociology, like science, relies on observable and testable data.
* *Example*: M.N. Srinivas’ study on **Sanskritisation** based on empirical data from Coorg region.

#### 2. **Segmentation (Reductionism)**

* Sociologists analyze phenomena by breaking them into parts and sub-parts.
* *Example*: Village study via caste system, jajmani system, family units — known as **reduction analysis**.

#### 3. **Causal Analysis**

* Sociology seeks **cause-effect relationships**, like science.
* *Example*: **Max Weber** in *The Protestant Ethic and Spirit of Capitalism* — religious beliefs led to capitalism.

#### 4. **Objectivity**

* Sociology aims to be free of bias, values, and opinions.
* *Example*: **R.K. Merton’s Theory of Deviance** identifies 5 types through objective classification.

#### 5. **Theory Building**

* Like natural sciences, sociology tries to form generalised theories.
* *Example*: **Durkheim’s Division of Labour** based on empirical studies.

#### 6. **Experimentation**

* Sociologists conduct experiments like scientists.
* *Example*: **Hawthorne & Marshall Studies** — impact of illumination on worker productivity, and delayed gratification.

#### 7. **Reliability & Validity**

* **Reliability**: Consistency of results.
* **Validity**: Accuracy and generalizability.
* *Example*: **Durkheim’s Suicide Study** emphasized both.

#### 8. **Use of Scientific Method**

* Sociology employs observation, statistical tools, experiments, and historical methods.
* *Example*: Durkheim’s methodological framework in **Suicide**.

###  **Criticism: Why Sociology Can’t Be Fully Scientific**

#### 1. **Dynamic Human Behaviour**

* Human actions are unpredictable, influenced by free will and social context.

#### 2. **Lack of Universal Laws**

* Difficult to generalize social behaviour like physical sciences.

#### 3. **Phenomenology & Ethnomethodology**

* No objective reality; emphasizes **subjective experience and common-sense knowledge**.
* Hence, rejects positivist scientific model in sociology.

#### 4. **Values Influence Facts**

* Researchers’ **ideology, values, and opinions** influence outcomes.
* *Example*: **Tepoztlán Village Study**:

  * Robert Redfield saw harmony;
  * Oscar Lewis saw conflict — researcher bias shaped findings.

#### 5. **Lack of Law-like Generalisation**

* Social phenomena are too diverse and evolving for fixed laws.

#### 6. **Difficulty in Quantification**

* Variables like **solidarity, happiness, stratification** are hard to measure numerically.

#### 7. **Challenge of Objectivity**

* Sociology struggles to maintain total objectivity — essential for scientific status.

###  **Conclusion**

* Despite borrowing methods and tools from science, **sociology doesn’t satisfy all criteria** of natural sciences.
* It is **neither completely scientific nor unscientific**.
* Most scholars place it in the realm of **“Social Science”**, blending empirical inquiry with interpretive flexibility.
