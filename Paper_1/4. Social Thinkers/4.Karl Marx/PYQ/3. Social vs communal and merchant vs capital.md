## **I. Difference between Socialism and Communism**

| **Criteria**                    | **Socialism (Dictatorship of the Proletariat)**                                                                            | **Communism**                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Nature of State**          | The state assumes control over the **means of production and distribution**.                                               | As per **Marx**, the state will eventually **wither away**. Engels stated the state would be “**kept in a museum**”. |
| **2. Ownership of Resources**   | **Private ownership exists**, but in a **limited and regulated form**. The state attempts to **progressively abolish** it. | **No private property**; resources are owned **collectively or communally** by society.                              |
| **3. Class Structure**          | **Class divisions exist**, though the aim is to **reduce inequality** and promote equity through redistribution.           | Aims to create a **classless society** with no hierarchical divisions.                                               |
| **4. Army, Police, Governance** | **State machinery** such as the army, police, and government remain functional to maintain order.                          | These **institutions cease to exist**. Rules are **internalised** by individuals through collective consciousness.   |
| **5. Goal**                     | To promote an **egalitarian society** by ensuring **equitable distribution** of resources.                                 | Establishment of a **stateless and classless society** ensuring **equal access** to resources for all.               |
| **6. Notion of Equality**       | Accepts **inequality temporarily** as a means to an end—**redistribution** is used to bring the poor at par with others.   | Aims for **absolute equality** where no individual is placed above another.                                          |

## **II. Mercantilism vs Capitalism**

| **Criteria**                        | **Mercantilism**                                                                         | **Capitalism**                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Time Period**                  | Predominantly followed from the **16th to 18th century**.                                | Emerged in the **post-18th century** following the Industrial Revolution.                  |
| **2. Trade Model**                  | Follows **monopoly over trade** and strong **protectionist policies**.                   | Promotes **free trade** and **open competition** across markets.                           |
| **3. Characteristic Features**      | Heavily **regulated trade and commerce** by the state.                                   | Encourages **laissez-faire economy**, limiting state intervention.                         |
| **4. Ownership Pattern**            | **State owns and controls** the means of production and distribution of services.        | **Private ownership** of both **resources** and **means of production**.                   |
| **5. Nationalism vs Individualism** | Strong sense of **economic nationalism**, prioritising state interests.                  | Focus on **individual rights**, property, and personal wealth accumulation.                |
| **6. Tariffs and Taxes**            | Imposes **high tariffs and taxes** on imports to protect domestic industries.            | Favors **low tariffs and open markets** to enhance trade flows and profits.                |
| **7. Goal / Aim**                   | Accumulate **wealth and resources** for the state, often via colonialism and bullionism. | Generate **private profit**, reinvest surplus, and enable capital expansion.               |
| **8. Criticism**                    | Promotes **zero-sum philosophy** — one nation's gain is another's loss.                  | Leads to **exploitation of labour** and **appropriation of surplus value** by capitalists. |

## **Conclusion:**

* **Socialism and Communism**, though ideologically connected, differ significantly in terms of state function, class structure, and approach toward ownership.
* **Mercantilism and Capitalism** differ fundamentally in their **economic orientation** — one is **state-centric and protectionist**, the other is **market-driven and individualistic**.
* Both comparisons help in understanding the **evolution of economic systems** and their implications on **class, state, and society**, making them crucial topics for **Sociology Optional (Paper I & II)** and **GS papers**.
