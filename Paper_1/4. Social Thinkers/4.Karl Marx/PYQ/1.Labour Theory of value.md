## **Marx’s Labour Theory of Value and/or Surplus Value of labour**

### **1. Classical Foundations**

* The Labour Theory of Value was originally developed by **Adam Smith** and **David Ricardo**.
* They argued that the **value of a commodity** is determined by:

  * The **social necessity** of the product, and
  * The **amount of labour time** required to produce it.
* According to them, the **capitalist class** rightly claims a share of the product’s value since they undertake the **risk** involved in the production process.
* The value of a commodity is determined by the **average labour time** required to produce it under **normal conditions**, using **average skill levels** and **simple technology**.

### **2. Marx’s Revision of the Theory**

* Marx retained the labour theory’s core but provided a critical reinterpretation.

* He emphasized that **labour alone** is the true source of all value in a commodity.

### **3. Capitalist Manipulation of Labour and Value**

* In a capitalist mode of production:

  * **Advanced technologies** are deployed not to empower labour, but to **reduce the labour time** per unit of commodity.
  * Capitalists also attempt to **artificially inflate demand** to promote the *social necessity* of certain products, thereby justifying production regardless of real societal needs.
* This leads to an **imbalance** where labourers contribute disproportionately to the value but receive **only a fraction** of it in wages.

### **4. Concept of Surplus Value**

* **Surplus value** refers to the **difference between the value produced by the worker** and the **wages paid to them**.
* For instance:

  * If a worker produces commodities worth ₹100 in a day but receives only ₹20 as wages, the remaining ₹80 is appropriated by the capitalist as **surplus value**.
* This unpaid labour is the **basis of capitalist profit** and reflects the **exploitation** inherent in the system.

### **5. Exploitation of Labour**

* Capitalists **do not compensate workers** for the actual value they create.
* Workers are treated as **instruments of production**, and the **surplus they generate** is diverted entirely toward **capitalist accumulation**.
* This leads to:

  * **Economic exploitation**
  * **Alienation of workers** from their own labour, the production process, the final product, and even from fellow workers.

### **6. Marx’s Critique of Classical Economists**

* Marx criticised Adam Smith and Ricardo for **ignoring the exploitative character** of capitalist labour relations.
* He proposed a **revision** of the theory to account for:

  * The unequal distribution of surplus value,
  * The dehumanising effect of commodification of labour.

### **7. Structural Obstacles in Modern Capitalism**

* Marx acknowledged that ensuring a **fair distribution** of surplus value is difficult in a world dominated by:

  * **Advanced technologies**, and
  * **Global supply chains**, which complicate wage fairness and reinforce capitalist control.
* The system’s very design prevents labour from receiving its **rightful share**, making **reform inadequate**.

### **8. Marx’s Prescription – Revolution**

* Given the structural limitations of capitalism, Marx saw **revolution** as the **only viable solution**.
* He envisioned:

  * **Abolition of private ownership of means of production**
  * Establishment of a **classless society**
  * Workers regaining control over production and receiving the **full value of their labour**

### **Conclusion**

Marx’s Labour Theory of Value goes beyond mere calculation of commodity worth; it is a **structural critique of capitalist production**. While classical economists focused on market dynamics, Marx exposed the **systemic appropriation of labour** by capital. His theory of **surplus value** remains central to understanding **exploitation and inequality** in modern economies.
