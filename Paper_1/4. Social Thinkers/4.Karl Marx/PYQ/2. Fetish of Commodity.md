## **Karl Marx – Fetishism of Commodities**

### **1. Introduction and Context**

* The concept appears in Marx’s book **“Das Kapital”** under the title "Fetishism of commodities and money" brought the idea of alienation and fetishism of commodity.
* Under capitalism, Marx explains that commodities not only serve utilitarian purposes but also reflect distorted social relations.
* This phenomenon is referred to as the **fetishism of commodities**, where commodities are assigned a value **independent of human labour** and the **social relations** involved in their production.Even commodities looses its purpose or need for which they were created.The commodity becomes market bond and exists independently from their utility or requirement.

### **2. Meaning and Explanation**

#### a) **Use Value vs Exchange Value**

* **Use Value**: The actual utility or usefulness of a commodity (e.g. what it does for consumers).
* **Exchange Value**: The market worth of the commodity — how much it can be exchanged for (in terms of other commodities or money).
* In capitalism, **exchange value dominates use value**, as commodities are produced primarily for profit rather than need.

#### b) **Labour as a Source of Value**

* The value of a commodity arises from the **labour time and socially necessary** to produce it.
* However, the **labour process becomes hidden** in capitalism. What appears in the market is the product, **not the producer** or the labour behind it.
* Commodities are **produced by human labour**, yet they appear to exist **independently** in the market.

#### c) **Objectification and Alienation**

* Commodities seem to have **inherent value**, making the efforts of workers **invisible**.
* Labour itself is commodified — workers are treated as objects.
* This creates **alienation** where workers become **powerless**, feeling detached from the product of their own labour.

### **3. Fetishism as a Social Illusion**

* Fetishism refers to a condition where **social relationships between people** are masked and appear as **relationships between things (commodities)**.
* In the capitalist mode of production, commodities **acquire mystical qualities** and are **perceived as self-sufficient entities**.
* As a result, the **worker-capitalist relation is obscured**. Instead of seeing a shoe made by a labourer, we see only the price tag or the brand.
* This illusion results in the **normalisation of exploitation** , as it hides the human labour and the exploitation behind making that product.

### **4. Illustration**

> A luxury watch is admired for its brand, prestige, and cost. The social processes, class exploitation, and labour involved in its production are **ignored**. The commodity becomes **fetishised**, masking the **human suffering** behind its creation.

### **5. Consequences of Commodity Fetishism**

* Reinforces **capitalist ideology** by detaching commodities from human work.
* **Dehumanises workers** and **hides class relations**.
* Generates a **false consciousness**, preventing the working class from recognising their exploitation.
* Reduces human beings to commodities — **labourers appear like objects** sold and bought in the market.
* Makes the product itself a source of alienation for the producer.

### **6. Marx’s Solution**

* Marx believed that giving labourers a **greater share in the surplus value** is not structurally feasible within capitalism due to advanced technology and globalised production chains.
* Therefore, **revolution**, not reform, is the only viable solution to eliminate exploitation and restore human dignity.

### **7. Criticisms of Fetishism of Commodities**

1. **Lacks empirical grounding**; highly abstract and philosophical in nature.
2. Overemphasises capitalist societies; ignores similar symbolic attachments in non-capitalist contexts.
3. Underestimates **consumer rationality** and their capacity for critical evaluation.
4. Seen as **ideologically biased** towards anti-capitalist propaganda.
5. **Oversimplifies market behaviour** – many commodities are valued due to real demand and utility, not fetishisation.

---

### **8. Summary**

Marx’s concept of **commodity fetishism** reveals how under capitalism, the true nature of social relations is **distorted**. Commodities appear to possess value **in themselves**, masking the **human labour** and **class exploitation** embedded within. This ideological illusion sustains capitalism by **naturalising alienation** and **depersonalising the worker**, turning both product and producer into commodities.
