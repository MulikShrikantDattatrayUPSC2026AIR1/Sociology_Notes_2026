## **Class Struggle – Karl Marx**



---

### **1. Introduction: Origin and Meaning of Class**

* The term *class* originates from the Latin word **‘classis’**, referring to a group of people.
* **Marx defined class** as a group occupying a similar position in the **production process**.
* **Famous quote**: *“The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle.”*
* Marx believed that every historical phase is marked by a **dominant class structure** and corresponding **class conflict**, which acts as a **driver of historical change**.

---

### **2. Marx’s Criteria for Class Formation**



Marx developed a two-fold criterion to understand how classes emerge in society — **objective** and **subjective**. These two dimensions explain not only *who belongs to a class*, but also *when a class becomes historically significant* in driving social change.

---

#### **A. Objective Criterion (Class-in-itself)**

#### **Definition:**

* A class is defined **objectively** based on an individual's **relation to the means of production** — whether they **own** the means or **sell their labour** to those who do.

#### **Explanation:**

* It does **not depend** on how individuals perceive themselves.
* It is **structural and economic**, rooted in one's position in the **production process**.
* For example:

  * In **capitalism**, the **bourgeoisie** owns factories, capital, and means of production.
  * The **proletariat** owns nothing but their capacity to work (labour power).

#### **Why it is called "Objective":**

* It is **externally observable** and **verifiable**, independent of personal beliefs or awareness.
* People in the same class **share common material conditions** — e.g., similar income sources, job roles, and vulnerabilities.
* Class formation here is **determined by economic facts**, not personal consciousness.

#### **Key Characteristics:**

* People **may not be aware** of their class position.
* No collective identity or struggle.
* Marx called this **“Class-in-itself”** (*Klasse an sich*) — a class **without class consciousness**.

---

#### **B. Subjective Criterion (Class-for-itself)**

#### **Definition:**

* A class is formed **subjectively** when people who are already objectively in the same class **develop awareness** of their shared exploitation and unite for collective action.

#### **Explanation:**

* It requires **class consciousness** — understanding of:

  * Their exploitation,
  * Their position in the capitalist system,
  * The need for solidarity and struggle.

* Example:

  * When workers realize that they are exploited as a class and organise strikes, unions, or revolutions.

#### **Why it is called "Subjective":**

* Based on **internal perception and awareness**.
* Emerges through **experiences of alienation, exploitation**, and political/social **mobilisation**.
* Class here is not just **a structural category**, but **a conscious, active force**.

#### **Key Characteristics:**

* Collective identity is formed.
* Members are **aware of their position** and **seek change** through organised efforts.
* Marx called this **“Class-for-itself”** (*Klasse für sich*) — a **class with political consciousness**.

### **Transition: From Class-in-itself to Class-for-itself**

| **Stage**     | **Class-in-itself**                         | **Class-for-itself**                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basis**     | Economic structure                          | Political & ideological consciousness              |
| **Awareness** | Absent                                      | Present                                            |
| **Action**    | Passive, fragmented                         | Active, collective struggle                        |
| **Example**   | Factory workers unaware of common condition | Workers forming trade unions, revolutionary action |

> **Revolution becomes possible only when objective class position is converted into subjective class consciousness.**

---

### **Synthesis: Why Marx Used Both Criteria**

* **Objective criterion** is crucial to **locate** people structurally within a class.
* **Subjective criterion** is essential to understand **when and how a class becomes a historical actor**.
* Marx argued that **both criteria are essential** for a class to become an agent of **revolutionary transformation**.

---


### **3. Origin of Class and Class Division**

* Class division arises with the **private ownership** of the **means of production**.
* Earlier communal ownership (e.g., primitive communism) is replaced by **individual/private control**.
* This shift creates **economic inequality**, dividing society into:

  * **Haves** (owners)
  * **Have-nots** (non-owners)

---

### **4. Class Structure Across Modes of Production**

| **Mode of Production** | **Dominant Class Division** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ancient Society        | Masters vs Slaves           |
| Feudal Society         | Lords vs Serfs              |
| Capitalist Society     | Bourgeoisie vs Proletariat  |

* Each stage reflects the **same underlying dynamic** of exploitation and conflict.

---

### **5. Intermediate Classes and Polarisation**

* Marx acknowledged **intermediary classes** in his work *“Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany”*, including:

  * Landlords, Peasants, Petty Bourgeoisie, Middle Class, Lumpen Proletariat.
* However, with **technological and economic advancement**, these classes are:

  * **Absorbed into two main classes**, through:

    * **Bourgeoisisation** (upward mobility)
    * **Proletarianisation** (downward mobility)
* This results in **polarisation** of society, increasing class antagonism.As polarisation results into intense competition between capitalists that leads to exploitation of proletarait , as to generate surplus and capture market.

* Production is made cheaper by lowering the wages of the proletariat due to intense competition and the surplus gained is accumulated by capitalist.

* Finally the intermediatry classes will be completely wiped out and only 2 classes remain with strong class antagonism , leading to situation of class struggle

---

### **6. Mechanism of Class Struggle**

* Triggered by **technological changes** that transform:

  * **Forces of production**
  * **Relations of production**
* Example:

  * Introduction of **agrarian machinery** in feudal society → large-scale production → need for processing → **mechanisation**.
  * This alters the structure of society, including:

    * **Family** (Joint → Nuclear)
    * **Marriage** (Sacred → Contractual)
    * **Law** (Traditional → Codified)
    * **State** (Monarchy → Democracy)

* With mechanisation there , workers are more exploitate and also alienated .
---

### **7. Exploitation and Alienation**

* Under capitalism, the **proletariat** faces:

  * **Exploitation** (labour surplus appropriated by capitalists)
  * **Alienation** (from product, labour, self, and others)
* This leads to **mass discontent** and awareness, prompting revolutionary transformation.

---

### **8. Transition to Communism**

* Extreme exploitation leads the proletariat (class-in-itself) to become **class-for-itself**.
* With **supportive conditions** (network, ideology, mass mobilisation, identification of common enemy), revolution becomes inevitable.
* Results in **dictatorship of the proletariat**, abolition of class divisions, and establishment of **communist society**.

---

### **9. Final Outcome: End of Dialectics and History**

* In the **final stage**, society becomes:

  * **Classless**
  * **Stateless**
  * **Egalitarian**
* No private property, no exploitation, no dialectics → **end of historical development** as per Marx.

---

### **10. Criticisms of Marx's Class Struggle Theory**

1. **Predictive Weakness**:

   * The idea that proletariat victory is inevitable is speculative and historically unverified.

2. **Embougeoisement** (Goldthorpe’s Oxford Study):

   * The **middle class will expands** rather than being absorbed into proletariat or bourgeoisie.

3. **No Clear Polarisation** (Burn & Stalker):

   * A **new class emergence** is possible, which does not align fully with either proletariat or bourgeoisie.

4. **Gandhian Critique**:

   * Society progresses not through conflict but **cooperation**.

5. **Empirical Gaps**:

   * Class struggle in modern capitalist societies is **not intensified**, and appears **fragmented**.

---

### **11. Contemporary Relevance**



While Marx’s predictions about proletarian revolution and classless society did not materialise as envisioned, the **core analytical framework of class struggle** remains highly relevant in understanding present-day **social, economic, and global inequalities**.

---

### **1. Neo-Colonialism and Economic Dependence**

* Even after formal decolonisation, **developing countries remain economically dependent** on former colonial powers and multinational corporations.
* Marx’s theory explains this as a **global extension of class struggle**, where:

  * **Developed nations** act as the *global bourgeoisie*.
  * **Developing nations** function as the *global proletariat* — exploited through unfair trade, debt traps, and extraction of cheap labour and raw materials.
* Scholars like **Andre Gunder Frank** and **Immanuel Wallerstein** built on this, describing the **core–periphery dynamics** of global capitalism.

---

### **2. Inequality in Global Capitalism**

* Within countries, **income and wealth inequality** have widened significantly, especially post-globalisation.
* The **top 1%** of the global population controls more wealth than the bottom 50%.
* Labour markets are increasingly **precarious**, with gig work, informalisation, and stagnant real wages.
* These developments align with **Marx’s concept of surplus value extraction** and ongoing exploitation of labour.

> **Thomas Piketty’s** empirical work reinforces Marx’s concern — capital accumulation grows faster than wages, reproducing inequality.

---

### **3. North-South Power Asymmetry**

* The **Global North** controls:

  * Finance
  * Technology
  * Institutional power (e.g., WTO, IMF, World Bank)
* The **Global South** remains dependent, marginalised, and **subjected to structural adjustment programs**, labour export, and environmental degradation.
* Marxian lens helps us see this as a **transnational form of class exploitation** — where class struggle is now also **geopolitical and institutionalised**.

---

### **4. Sociological Utility in Present-Day Analysis**

* Class struggle is no longer confined to the **factory floor** — it plays out in:

  * **Education**: access gap between elite and marginalised
  * **Healthcare**: class-based disparity in treatment and access
  * **Urban space**: gentrification vs displacement
  * **Labour laws**: dilution of protections, rise in contract work
* The framework remains valuable for understanding **structural inequalities**, **power hierarchies**, and **institutional biases**.

---

### **5. Modern Movements and Class Consciousness**

* Movements such as:

  * **Occupy Wall Street**
  * **Fight for \$15 (USA)**
  * **Labour protests in developing economies**
* These echo Marx’s idea of **emerging class-for-itself**, where exploited sections recognise systemic issues and mobilise collectively.

---

### **6. Relevance Beyond Economics**

* Class struggle intersects with:

  * **Caste (in India)**: Economic class and caste-based oppression often reinforce each other.
  * **Gender**: Feminist economists highlight the gendered dimensions of class (e.g., unpaid labour).
  * **Race**: Structural racism in labour and housing markets is a class issue with racial dimensions.

---

### **Conclusion**

Despite the evolution of capitalism and the diversification of oppression, **Marx’s class struggle remains a powerful analytical tool**. It helps unpack **systemic exploitation**, **global inequality**, and **power asymmetries** — both within and across societies. Rather than becoming obsolete, it has become more nuanced and globally applicable in today’s interconnected worlda and Offers a valuable lens for **sociological analysis** of present-day economic and political systems.
Marx’s theory of class struggle acts as a **motor of history**, explaining social transformation through structural contradictions between classes. It remains a foundational framework in sociology, despite evolving critiques and empirical limitations.
