### 1. **Introduction**

* American sociologist who developed a general theory of social action and social system.

---

### 2. **Influence of Max Weber**

* Weber considered social action as a subject of sociology.
* Defined social action as action oriented towards others with meaning attached.
* Used *ideal type* method.
* Gave two conditions for identifying social action:

  * It must be oriented toward others.
  * It must have meaning attached by the actor.

### 3. **Parsons' Modification of Weber’s Concept**

Parsons structured Weber's idea by providing **four conditions** for any action to be considered social action (Mnemonic: **SDRI**):

1. **Social Setting**: Action must occur in a social context (e.g., school, family).
2. **Norms & Values**: Action must be regulated by social norms and values.
3. **Goal-Oriented**: Action must aim toward achieving a goal.
4. **Investment of Energy**: Action must involve effort or motivation.

### 4. **Examples of Social Action**

* Attending school:

  * Social setting: school as an institution.
  * Regulated by norms: rules and discipline.
  * Goal: knowledge acquisition.
  * Investment: time and effort to study.
* Other examples: voting in elections, participating in sports teams, family functions, corporate work.

### 6. **Types of Social Action (Parsons)**

Based on two orientations:

* **Motivation Orientation**: Situation-based, focused on individual requirements.
* **Value Orientation**: Based on societal ethics and morality.

Parsons classified social actions into three types:

#### a) **Instrumental Action**

* Driven by **cognitive motivation**.
* Goal-oriented and rational.
* Based on collective expectations of efficiency.
* Example: preparing for exams, working for salary.

#### b) **Expressive Action**

* Driven by **cathectic (emotional) motivation**.
* Aimed at emotional gratification and satisfaction.
* Guided by collective emotional values.
* Example: celebrating festivals, playing music for joy.

#### c) **Moral Action**

* Driven by **evaluative motivation**.
* Based on personal ethics and collective moral judgments.
* Example: donating, standing against injustice.

---

### 7. **Parsons' Contribution**

* Integrated Weber’s meaning-oriented action with his own structural-functional view.
* Emphasised interplay between:

  * Individual motivation
  * Societal norms and values
* Viewed social action as **a structured phenomenon**, governed by social systems and value consensus.

---

### 8. **Conclusion**

Parsons helped in conceptualising social action within a **systematic and structural framework**, making sociology more scientific and analytical. His work bridges individual agency and social structure.
